# ETL-Project

The project idea is to collaborate names of new borns and compare as to how many times people have used the same name for their pets as well and which are most used names for babies and pets.

Extraction

We used 2 datasets from the public platform Kaggle and also Google Big data query. All of our data was based on New York city from 1999. Also used Google Big Data query to retrive names from SSA and using SQL to query the full names dataset that are after the year 1999. Then convert the results of that query to a Pandas data frame . The sources for our dataset are as follows

•	Baby names from Kaggle. •	Dog Names from Kaggle.

Transformation

Our first steps in cleaning up the datasets involved figuring out which variables were not relevant and merged the cleaned data sets.

Load

The last step was to transfer our final output into a Database, exported the output pandas dataframe to .csv for import into MySQL database.
